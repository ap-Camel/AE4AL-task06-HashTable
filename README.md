# Hash table

## task description

Compare the time it takes to process a huge clear text file (e.g.  KingJames_Bible.zip) by the "Histogram of words in text files" using the HashTable data structure vs. the LinkedList or DynamicArray data structures.

## note

this code is different than what was done in class, I created the Hash table code myself
